## EPS

### Summary
- EPS = NetIncome-PreferredDividends/NumberOfShares
- Diluted EPS - Takes into account RSUs, options, etc.
  - Will always be equal to or lower than basic EPS (because it'll have more shares, ie. higher denominator)
- P/E = SharePrice/EPS

### Return on Investment
Self-Explanatory

### Basic EPS (Earnings per Share) https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp
1) Take the profit
2) Subtract preferred dividends 
3) Divide that number by the number of shares outstanding.


## Price-to-Earnings Ratio
- P/E - "E" refers to EPS
- P/E 10 or P/E 30 measures - Uses EPS over past 10/30 years
- The P/E ratio of the S&P 500 has fluctuated from a low of around 5x (in 1917) to over 120x
- S&P 500's Long term average P/E - 16x
- Forward P/E - Based on estimated Earnings in the future
- Trailing P/E - Based on past 12 months of performance

### What High vs. Low P/E entails
- High P/E - Expects higher earnings growth
- Low P/E - Undervalued or doing well relative to past trends


## Earnings Yield (E/P)
- EPS/Share (Inverse P/E)
- Not as useful as P/E 
- Low Earnings Yield - Overvalued stock
- High Earnings Yield - Undervalued stock


## PEG (Price/Earnings-To-Growth Ratio)
- Way to measure forward growth
- PEG Ratio - Trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio / GrowthRate
- PEG ratios can be 
  - “trailing” if using historic growth rates 
  - “forward” if using projected growth rates
- Undervalued - Stock w/ PEG < 1
- Overvalued - Stock w/ PEG > 1
